# figTalks

I have recently come to realize that as long as I am often working with the
same figures for my talks and given that they were created with R, I would likely
benefit from storing them in one place to prevent me from having the same
pieces of code in different folders. So I have created this repo!


R packages required so far:

- graphicsutils
- showtext
